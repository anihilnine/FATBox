    HazardX - map file loading
    Duck_42 - tweaks to map file loading + map rendering

ideas:

    strategic preview
    unit browser, exporter
    blueprint browser
    map browser
    replays

todo:

    remove 7zip dependancy

    blueprints - add type

    support v60 maps
    
    make the ui apps accessible and more useful, seperate, use launchtools

    units BUILTBYTIER3FACTORY,BUILTBYTIER3ENGINEER,COMMAND,BUILTBYQUANTUMGATE.
    need to group by description to get them to line up


make the replay viewer

make the strategic preview

partYtime:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Forged Alliance Forever\faforever.exe" "C:\ProgramData\FAForever\replays\2251043-partytime.fafreplay"
launch it this way to do upgrade... wait for fa.exe to start then kill it ... rerun it from temp\ with mod enabled


initializer:
        make fa.exe path a setting as well (registry?) 
        and map folders?
        whilst blueprintdump is happening, show a window explaining what is happening?
        have a faf launch dialog that is sometimes silent
        blueprints need type
