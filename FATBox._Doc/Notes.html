    HazardX - map file loading
    Duck_42 - tweaks to map file loading + map rendering

ideas:

    strategic preview
    unit browser, exporter
    blueprint browser
    map browser
    replays

todo:

    make the ui apps accessible and more useful

    make the replay viewer

    initializer:
        make fa.exe path a setting as well (registry?) 
        and map folders?
        whilst blueprintdump is happening, show a window explaining what is happening?
        have a faf launch dialog that is sometimes silent
